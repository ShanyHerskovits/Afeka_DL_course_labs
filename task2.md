Homework 2
1. Use the dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository: "Individual household electric
power consumption" for performing time series analysis.
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/235/individual+household+electric+power+consumption
**RAN** (convert to csv / Parquet)

2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the dataset:
 - Visualize time series trends
 - Check for seasonality and cyclical patterns
 - Analyze distribution of power consumption
 - Identify and handle missing values or outliers
**SHANY**

3. Implement a linear regression model to predict power consumption for the last three time
periods:
 - Split the data into training and testing sets
 - Prepare features (consider lag variables, time-based features)
 - Train the model and make predictions
**Shany**

4. Evaluate the linear regression model using appropriate metrics:
 - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
 - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
 - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
 - R-squared (R²) value
**RAN** 

5. Implement a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for power consumption prediction:
 - Preprocess data for RNN input
 - Design and train the RNN model
 - Make predictions and visualize results
 - Compare performance metrics with linear regression
**RAN**

6. Implement Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for power consumption prediction:

 - Compare performance metrics with previous models
**Shany**

7. Implement an LSTM model with an Attention layer for power consumption prediction:
 - Design and train the LSTM model with Attention
 - Make predictions and visualize results
 - Compare performance metrics with previous models
 - Analyze the Attention weights to interpret model focus
**Shany**

8. Data augmentation experiment:
 - Modify up to 10% of the dataset to potentially improve prediction results
 - Retrain and evaluate all three models (RNN, LSTM, LSTM with Attention)
 - Compare the impact of data changes on each model's performance
**RAN**

9. Data reduction experiment:
 - Remove up to 10% of the data randomly
 - Retrain and evaluate all three models
 - Compare how data reduction affects each model's performance
**RAN**

10. Data resolution experiment:
 - Reduce the time resolution of the data by 50% (e.g., from minute-level to 2-minute
intervals)
 - Retrain and evaluate all three models
 - Analyze how changes in data resolution impact each model's performance
**SHANY** 

11. Conclusion and insights:
 - Summarize findings from all experiments
 - Discuss which model performed best under different conditions
 - Provide insights on the dataset's characteristics and their impact on model performance
